# Daniel Wahlgren
### Programming / AI Student

I'm passionate about solving problems and helping people. In June 2024, I began studying **Object-Oriented Programming with AI** at **NBI/Handelsakademin** in Gothenburg.

I have experience in both **IT/tech** and **web development**, and my goal is to gather knowledge, skills and experience towards becoming a **full stack developer**.

In June 2026 I will graduate from the education, and before then I will have two LiA-periods (Lärande i Arbete/Praktik) where I intend on gaining my first experience in the business and developing my programming and problem-solving skills.

I'm always open to collaborations! If you think my skills could benefit your project, feel free to reach out. :-)
